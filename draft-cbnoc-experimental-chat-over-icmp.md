This document defines a Chat over ICMP protocol.

# Introduction

Chat over ICMP protocol uses extra IP [@!RFC791] datagram bytes that are not used by ICMP [@!RFC792] to transport messages.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Specification

## Format

A datagram used in Chat over ICMP protocol is as follows :

Figure: A message structure of Chat over ICMP protocol


IP Fields (derived from ICMP):

Addresses

: The ip address of the source in a chat message will be the
  destination of the chat message.  If a sender wants to
  broadcast the message across the Topic space, the ip address
  of the destination should be a broadcast address.

IP Fields (derived from ICMP):

Type

: 8 for a chat message. In ICMP, this value means an echo message.

Code

: Always set to 0

Checksum

: The checksum is the 16-bit ones's complement of the one's
  complement sum of the ICMP message starting with the ICMP Type.
  For computing the checksum , the checksum field should be zero.
  If the total length is odd, the received data is padded with one
  octet of zeros for computing the checksum.  This checksum may be
  replaced in the future.

Identifer
Sequence Number

: Not using it. Anything is fine. But may be zero.

Addresses

: The address of the source in an echo message will be the
  destination of the echo reply message.  To form an echo reply
  message, the source and destination addresses are simply reversed,
  the type code changed to 0, and the checksum recomputed.

Topic

: The Identifier and Sequence Number fields defined by ICMP is
  repurposed to represent Topic of the chat. Topic act as an
  identifier of a chat room so the receiver can categorize messages
  based on the value.


# Security Considerations

Chat over ICMP protocol does not define any protection of message bytes. Therefore, it MUST NOT be used to carry sensitive data which should be securely transported. An implementation should consider that the data is not protected in any ways and it should give appropriate notice to its users about that risk.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
